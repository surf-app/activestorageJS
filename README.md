# ActiveStorageJS

A module for implementing the Ruby on Rails frameworks' ActiveStorage strategy for dealing with blob data. It was created to ease the transition between Rails and any JavaScript framework.

The service exposes two methods of storing data. Disk storage for testing and development environments, and cloud based storage (AWS S3) in staging and production environments.
